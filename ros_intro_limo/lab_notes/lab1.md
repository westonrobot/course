# Lab 1 Notes

**NOTE**: BACKUP IMPORTANT FILES BEFORE YOU START ANY INSTALLATION 

## 1. Install Ubuntu 18.04 

### 1.1 Preparation 

Setting up bootable USB for Ubuntu (Refer to the detailed guide section below to see how to set up) 

4GB minimum (empty USB stick) 

Rufus/Etcher application (for creating live USB/disk of Ubuntu) 

Ubuntu ISO image https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/ 

 

**Before installation, verify that your current system uses UEFI in the BIOS 

If unable to boot from USB, try disabling secure boot/fast boot in BIOS 

### 1.2 Disk Partition 

Suggested partitioning Size: 

/(root): root partition, ext4 format, >=25GB 

/swap: swap area,  

If <2GB ram, use 2x the size of RAM 

3GB â€“ 6GB, use same size as RAM 

>8GB, use half the size of RAM 

/home: ext4 format, allocate it rest of the free space (as much as possible) 

This is the place where you put most of your work files 

### 1.3 Installation 

You mostly only need to follow the Ubuntu installation guide and provide information such as user name, computer name, password etc.
